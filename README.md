# naivebayes
The primary goal of this project is to build a Naive Bayes classifier for a health-related classification problem. 

This project focuses on predicting the hospitalization need for individuals suspected of having COVID-19 based on various low-cost and easily acquired variables.

The evaluation results, including performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are stored in the results/ seection.

These results help in understanding the effectiveness of the classifier and its suitability for the given problem.
